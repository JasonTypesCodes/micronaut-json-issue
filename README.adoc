= Micronaut JSON Issue

Trying to recreate an issue I'm experiencing with Micronaut parsing JSON from a POST body.

== jhipster-micronaut Application

The `jhipster-micronaut` folder contains an application generated with the WIP JHipster Micronaut generator.

.Options used to generate the project
. "Monolithic Application"
. Webflux? `N`
. Name? `jhipsterMicronaut`
. Default Package? `io.github.jhipster.sample`
. Auth Type? `JWT`
. DB? `SQL`
. Production DB? `MySQL`
. Development DB? `H2 in-memory`
. Cache? `ehcache`
. Hibernate Cache? `Y`
. Build? `Maven`
. Other Technologies? `empty`
. Client Framework? `Angular`
. Bootswatch? `Default JHipster`
. Enable i18n? `Y`
. Native Language? `english`
. Additional Languages? `none`
. Other testing frameworks? `none`
. Other generators? `N`

After the project was generated, I generated the entities to match the sample application.

*Note*: I received errors when trying to set up entity relationships on the first pass,
so instead I would create the initial entities in one pass and then add the relationships in a second pass.

.Initial Entity Generation (Pass 1)
. `mhipster entity BankAccount`
. Add field `name` as `String` with validation rule `Required`
. Add field `balance` as `BigDecimal` with validation rule `Required`
. Rest Controller should use the repository directly
. Read only? `N`
. Pagination? `N`
. `mhipster entity Label`
. Add field `label` as `String` with validation rules `Required` and `Minimum Length`.  Minimum length is 3.
. Rest Controller should use the repository directly
. Read only? `N`
. Pagination? `N`
. `mhipster entity Operation`
. Add field `date` as `Instant` with validation rule `Required`
. Add field `description` as `String` with no validation rules
. Add field `amount` as `BigDecimal` with validation rule `Required`
. Rest Controller should use the repository directly
. Read only? `N`
. Pagination? `Infinite Scroll`

.Relationship Generation (Pass 2)
. `mhipster entity BankAccount`
. "Add more fields and relationships"
. `? Do you want to add a relationship to another entity? Yes`
. `? What is the name of the other entity? user`
. `? What is the name of the relationship? user`
. `? What is the type of the relationship? many-to-one`
. `? When you display this relationship on client-side, which field from 'user' do you want to use? This field will be displayed as a String, so it cannot be a Blob login`
. `? Do you want to add any validation rules to this relationship? No`
. `? Do you want to add a relationship to another entity? Yes`
. `? What is the name of the other entity? operation`
. `? What is the name of the relationship? operation`

. `? What is the name of this relationship in the other entity? label`
. `mhipster entity Operation`
. "Add more fields and relationships"
. `? Do you want to add a relationship to another entity? Yes`
. `? What is the name of the other entity? bankAccount`
. `? What is the name of the relationship? bankAccount`
